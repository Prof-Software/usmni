                    <p className="mb-8">
                        India is blessed with many unique craftsmanship. One such profession is of potters. But now this art is limited to some rural regions only. It is hard to find a good pot without a massive overhead price. Project "NEER" mainly focuses on uplifting the craftsmanship of the potter community in the city of Prayagraj. Despite many benefits of Pots/Pottery, the common mass prefers plastic. This not only affects the income of the potter community but also creates pollution. This art is gradually dying due to a lack of connectivity to the market and due to the use of excessive plastics. Not only will the project help the community to create another source of income, but it will also keep them motivated in what they do. Prayagraj is situated on the riverbanks of the Ganges. The groundwater needs minimal purification. The potter community in the city is highly skilled. It took us no time in finding a community which could do the job. Also, there are many poor communities of people who can’t afford RO water purifiers. Most of the commercially available water purifiers are costly and generally made up of plastics. So, to reduce the use of plastic and also encourage AatmaNirbhar Bharat Abhiyan we excel towards this project. By this project, we are also aiming to give the poor potter community a chance to expand their market other than their normal customers.

                    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">PRODUCT PROPOSAL</h2>
                    <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-8">
                        <li>The design of the water purifier will consist of two mud pots one on top of another with a little variation in size and shape. The main part of the purifier is a ceramic candle from which impurified water percolates downward to the lower container.</li>
                        <li>Turbidity, suspended materials, bacteria, protozoa, and cysts are removed (not pathogens) from water through mechanical trapping and adsorption in micro-scale pores of ceramic candles.</li>
                        <li>This method lowers the TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) of the water sample and gives you water of a certain TDS (but not below that).</li>
                        <li>The efficiency of the filter also depends on the production quality, the initial water quality, and the handling practices of users. Highly turbid or iron-containing water may plug candle pores easily so such containers and candles need to be cleaned frequently.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-8">
                        <li>Firstly, we conducted different market surveys so that we could get an idea of the use of the product.</li>
                        <li>Then we approached the potter communities and explained them the design of mud pot filter.</li>
                        <li>Then the samples of mud pot filter were collected and were tested on different water samples.</li>

                        <li>Maximum components should be possibly eco-friendly and at the same time not compromising with the health of customers.</li>
                        <li>Finding a design which is easy to comprehend and implement by potters.</li>
                        <li>The design should not require significantly extra time and effort which could eventually lead to a rise in cost.</li>
                        <li>Providing variations in the product to trigger the maximum possible market base.</li>

            <p className="mb-8">
              Our most recent venture in collaboration with the initiative by MHRD and state government of Uttar Pradesh under the <a href="http://odopup.in/en/article/district-profile-allahabad">'One District One Product Scheme'.</a> The project aims at empowering the indigenous Moonj based handicraft products which have been facing existential challenges over the years.
              <br /><br />
              Before diving into the project, we would love to introduce to you what this project is about. What moonj is? And why is Moonj basketry a pride for our Prayagraj.
              Moonj is the outer layer of a type of grass called ‘sarpat.’ This layer is peeled off and knotted as it is easy to store and dry. These knots are locally known as 'balla'. Kaasa grass is dried and wrapped with moonj grass by rolling around kaasa. The motifs of basketry are then formed by dyeing and stitching with great expertise. The final product baskets, have a touch of our culture.
              Moonj basketry comprises our Allahabad's oldest heritage and with time its awareness is decreasing. Hence to bring back this beautiful craft, we at Enactus decided to dive into this project and give this project the recognition it deserves.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-8">
              <strong className="text-xl underline">Motivation</strong><br /> 
              The Naini area of Allahabad has been recognized widely for its <a href="https://medium.com/direct-create/moonj-basketry-form-uttar-pradesh-cfd5aad98dd0">Moonj Craft.</a> But with time, it has been losing its charm and today it is significantly far from the time of its glory. The market offers a variety of products made from the moonj like basket(daliya in Hindi), coaster stand, bags, decorative items, and more. Eco-friendly moonj products have the potential to do well in national as well as the international markets.
              <br /><br />
              <strong className="text-xl underline">Goal</strong><br /> 
              The team aspires to plunge into the various aspects related to the supply chain, marketing, promotion, and technological R&amp;D assistance to tackle the various challenges that have been holding back this art to achieve the glory it deserves.

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Insights from our first field visit:</h3>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-8">
              <li>They are technologically deficient which means they are not at all prone to the e-commerce world.</li>
              <li>Kids and men aren't supporting women. The work solely is being done by women. Which leads to dependency on a middle man, who then takes away a lot of their profit. This also leads to a lack of interest in the younger generation which in turn leads to degradation of the whole art.</li>
              <li>Cost is too low. The monthly income of 1500 INR is too low regarding the time and efforts they put in.</li>
              <li>Production rate is slow. Since they don't prefer machines and do knitting by hand it takes a lot of time.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">LOOKING FORWARD TO</h2>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-8">
              <li>The manual process is time-consuming. At times, it takes weeks to design a moonj product. We are trying methods, which can be used in needle movement for knotting the spirals so that the products are masterly crafted. To create a space in the market, we need to increase production without affecting employment.</li>
              <li>We will use the cultural heritage of Prayagraj. The Magh Mela and other Fairs will act as a direct source of sale.</li>
              <li>Making them technologically aware so that they can be aware of the vast internet world. And make use of e-commerce websites.</li>
              <li>We are looking forward to do advertisements and help this artform regain its lost recognition.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mb-8">We are fully fledged to work on it again and receiving this beautiful heritage of Prayagraj.</p>

            <p className="mb-8">
              We aim at strengthening the initiatives being run by the government of India and various non-profit organizations by synergizing them to aggrandize the target masses through proper training, enabling them to make the most out of opportunities. We at ENACTUS aim to provide support for this noble work under "Project Sahyog". Our aim is reaching out to the underprivileged sections of society and making them aware of different schemes and policies undertaken by the government for their welfare and helping them avail those schemes.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-8">
              <strong className="text-xl underline">Motivation</strong><br /> 
              Despite the efforts of the government to increase the reach of its schemes and initiatives for the underprivileged, a section of society still remains left behind mainly due to the involvement of some sleazy middlemen. Lack of awareness and information deficit also exacerbate the problem. In this fast-paced digital era, lack of technical knowledge also holds back the underprivileged section and hinders their progress.

              We kickstarted the project in 2015-16 by aiming at replacing polythene bags with an eco-friendly, more economical substitute - Paper.
              <br />
              Our objective was to launch a viable and eco-friendly alternative to polythene bags, aiming at Self-Reliance and community empowerment. We primarily targeted women, providing them with the necessary aids, thus helping them enhance their skills as project workers and improvise wherever needed.
